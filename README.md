# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create an Extract, Transform, Load data pipeline for the multiple large movie-related datasets.  First, the data is scraped from the web, then the data is cleaned, extracted and transformed to a much more user-friendly format and composition.  Lastly, the datasets are loaded into an easily queryable database in SQL.

One example of the end-product of this ETL is the clean and concise dataframe displayed below showing the movie ratings:
